# accumulator-go

Utility to generate cryptographic accumulator to produce proof of membership or non membership using the pairing
BN256. 

Membership witness allow to generate a Zero Knowledge Proof
Non-Membership witness doesn't allow to generate a Zero Knowledge Proof (WIP)

> To avoid some flaws in terms of security, the implementation would need to leverage a more recent curve such as BLS12-381
